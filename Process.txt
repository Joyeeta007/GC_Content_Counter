Initiative 1:

I tried to make a gc content calculator

learnings:
1. Taking input
2. Looping through input
3. Calculation the stuff
4. knowing built in function about count

Initiative 2:

Noticed that the sequence user can give error, 
so I need to validate input

Learning:
1. loopin gthrough input
2. applied terms (not in) 

Initiative 3:

Noticed what I validated is initially it will just look for atgc but 
is also accepting the other strings if that contained atgc

learnings:
1. applied while loop
2. then run the input
3. if that contain invald string it will take input again and break if 
the sequence is valid.

Initiative 4:

looks like if I detect the error in the string input, it will make user
more observable in their sequence.

learnings:
1. Applying f'' in printing
